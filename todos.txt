fix the task modal in re-occuring tasks

- Create a verify task page

- make a users overview page

- implement a tablet view (restricted page)

-implement filter options

- implement finished date + time ,verified date + time in finished task

-hide finished and verified times when status = issue

<___implement @ KBL___>

- some clean up, i am now passing info through the modals which is not needed,
 since i can find the info based on task ID (see edit task modal in JS)


Known Bugs :
->Editing a task might create double rescheduled task (if reschedule is more then 1)
->list in edit task is not set to selected value -- FIXED
->issue status is not working in finished view -- FIXED
