fix the task modal in re-occuring tasks

- Create a verify task page

- make a users overview page

- implement a tablet view (restricted page)

- implement finished date + time ,verified date + time in finished task

-hide finished and verified times when status = issue

- implement a filter based on building, role and rights.

- reformat date input --> DONE --> require start and end date.(or check if is input)

- change completed to verified

- add comment when is re-openend is reported

<___implement @ KBL___>

- some clean up, i am now passing info through the modals which is not needed,
 since i can find the info based on task ID (see edit task modal in JS)


Known Bugs :
->Editing a task might create double rescheduled task (if reschedule is more then 1)
